VanityPhoneGenerator
===================

This little app gives you all english-word representations of your telephone number.\n

Input: A 10 digit telephone number.\n
Output: All possible 10 character english words that map to that number(if there exist any) \n

This app ignores phone numbers with 1's and 0's in them(as they are not part of the standard digit to character mapping)
